# Deep Learning
# Self-Driving Car Project

## Overview
This project involves building a virtual self-driving car that navigates a 2D map. We'll use Kivy for the user interface and PyTorch for implementing deep Q-learning AI.

## Prerequisites
1. **Kivy**: A Python framework for developing multitouch applications, required for creating the UI, buttons, widgets, and maps.
2. **PyTorch**: A deep learning library needed for implementing our AI.

## Installation Instructions

### Kivy
If you don't have Anaconda, or if you encounter an error stating that the Kivy module is not found, install Kivy manually:
```bash
pip install kivy
```

### PyTorch
Ensure that you have PyTorch installed as well:
```bash
pip install torch
```

## Project Details
### Description
Building a self-driving car is a complex problem. In this project, you'll create a virtual self-driving car that navigates a 2D map within a Kivy web app. While Kivy is used to build the environment and interface, PyTorch is utilized for the AI components.

### Main Map File

### Important Notes
- The Kivy framework is solely used for the graphical user interface and does not involve AI.
- PyTorch is essential for developing the deep Q-learning algorithm that drives the self-driving car's decision-making process.

By following this guide and ensuring the necessary installations, you'll be set to build and explore the intricacies of a virtual self-driving car using deep Q-learning AI within a Kivy environment.
