Self Driving  Car
1st make sure to install KIVY manually if you do not have anaconda, sometimes even if you do have it might inform you that no module found, at that moment make sure that you definitely install KIVY, by the command pip install kivy, likewise make sure that you even install torch.

We do need both these modules for building up our deep q learning AI, 
KIVY has nothing to do with AI, but it will help us to build UI, buttons, widgets, maps etc., 
But we need PyTorch for implementing our AI

This time, we have much more to define than just the states, actions and rewards. Building a self-driving car is a seriously complex problem. Now, I’m not going to ask you to go to your garage and turn yourself into a hybrid AI mechanic; you’re simply going to build a virtual self-driving car that moves around a 2D map. 

You’ll build this 2D map inside a Kivy webapp. Kivy is a free and open-source Python framework, used for the development of applications like games, or any kind of mobile app. Check out the website here: https://kivy.org/#home
The whole environment for this project is built with Kivy, from start to finish. The development of the map and the virtual car has nothing to do with Artificial Intelligence, so we won’t go line by line through the code that implements it.
You can directly get the map file from:
https://github.com/AbhinayRao593/DeepLearningSelfDriving/blob/main/map_commented.py

It do have step by step information about what all we are going to use for the implementation, and why?

You can get the main map file here:
https://github.com/AbhinayRao593/DeepLearningSelfDriving/blob/main/map.py

Now comes the challenge, we will write the entire Deep Q Learning AI ourself.

So, Let’s start…
